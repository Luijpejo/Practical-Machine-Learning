# Practical-Machine-Learning
Repository for publishing my final assignment of the PML course of Data Scientist specialisation

This repository contains two files:
1. The file "Final assignment ML.Rmd". This contains the markdown file that I have created to answer the assignment
2. The file Final assignment ML.html, that has been generated with Knitr, based on the R markdown file.

I do not know exactly how to make these two files visible.
One option I saw is adding respectively 
"#Final assignment ML.Rmd" or
"#Final assignment ML.html"
